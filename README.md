Welcome to DELTA!
===================
Before you start to delve into the contents of this git, make sure you've been able to set a meeting with me. If you haven't yet, it's a *must*. It's important to have you guys know what the whole purpose of this community is, what we aim to do, what we will be doing, and what you *want* to be able to do at the end of all of this. So make sure you already have for you get the substance of the content over here. :) 

As for the rest of you, read on. Here's the general outline of what we discussed, and some additional details. According to you guys, most of you are available on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays online for the Skype sessions (in that order).

Introduction
------------------
This is the community GIT page with all the resources. Basically, we want to go from this:

*You get the point.*

## What's in it for me?
Through this community, you will be able to experience how it is to work in an environment that encourages innovation, constructive criticism and output that creates a positive impact on the society we live in today. 

Besides lessons and consultancy, you get access to exclusive resources in the Philippines (I usually get ahold of the latest tech before anyone else does in the country), as well as a special network of people that you could be connected with in the very near future depending on which direction you choose to follow. I know a multitude of investors, developers and collaborators waiting for your next big idea! 

External opportunities are also out there, such as joining *meaningful* summits, being able to work as sort of a pseudo-intern when working on projects at offices in Katipunan and at Technohub or at my workspace in Greenbelt. 

Lastly, there will be talks (the non-boring ones, I guarantee it) with different speakers who are personal friends of mine. They'll be all ears if you have any ideas you want to pitch out to them. 

## Do I have to pay for this?
The community is non-profit and although I have paid workshops that you may want to attend that aren't affiliated to this group at all, you won't be charged any money! That also means any project you will want to work on would be out of your own pockets. 

Why don't I ask people to pay? It's simple. We have a vision. Like we talked about, the community isn't all about building cool stuff. We're here to set our sights on self-improvement, creating a lasting influence for generations to come, and to give back to our country when the time comes! It's a bonus that you'll get to meet different kinds of people that I'll introduce you to from time to time and hopefully you can realize your dreams through them! 

## Any formal commitments? 
Absolutely not. You may drop in and out of a lecture setup anytime you want. Projects will be posted on the page and if you're interested on working on it, you can go! If you don't, that's fine too. **Fair warning** though, some lessons are interconnected and you might have a hard time catching up if you skip on a lot of them. People in the community would gladly help you though. I'm sure. 



## The Challenge

In a span of n weeks. In general, we will try to keep a breakneck pace (since everyone seems to be up to the challenge) and give ourselves lots and lots of things to think about. In particular, the course is based on the following principles:

* Questions >> answers
* Challenges should approach the ideal of the k≈çan and provoke "great doubt".
* But not great enough to require doubting for over an hour -- we're still students after all!
* 
## Getting Help
The DELTA Maker Community group (As of this term) meets on Tuesdays, Thursdays and on Facebook. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on our group chat, or post on the FB page.  

That includes (but doesn't get limited to):
 
* Queries regarding troubleshooting
* Invitations to participate in events and competitions
* Invitations to participate in project making 
*  Useful links or interesting reads


## Getting Started

Step 1: Install the Arduino IDE (The latest one)

Step 2: Install Skype and/or Facebook Messenger

Step 3: ???

Step 4: Grow wings and create!
